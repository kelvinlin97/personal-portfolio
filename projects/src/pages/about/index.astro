      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Kelvin and I'm a software engineer with around 2 years of experience in the fintech space. I was born and raised in NYC and went to college in Boston where I had more of an accounting/finance-heavy courseload. I transitioned to software engineering around 2021 and have been
        in the field ever since. In my freetime, I enjoy running, drawing, and playing games.
